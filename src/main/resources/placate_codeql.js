This file exists solely to prevent CodeQL from failing its "Analyze (javascript-typescript)" action with:

CodeQL detected code written in Java/Kotlin, Python and GitHub Actions, but not any written in JavaScript/TypeScript. Confirm that there is some source code for JavaScript/TypeScript in the project.

Because apart from the contents of this file, there is currently no JavaScript or TypeScript in the GATK repo.
